				<p>Hi everyone! Vignesh here, F1 with an interest in cardiology :) I'll be doing a teaching session for you guys this Wednesday (29th August) on ECGs and arrhythmias as part of the 'Acute Medicine' teaching course that Patrick Murphy is organising.</p> 
				
				<p>As this can be a topic in which people have varying experience levels and expectations of what will be taught, it would be super duper helpful if you could please fill in this form, so that I can tailor the session as close as possible to exactly what you all want! :)</p>

				<p> <strong>Question:</strong> Please change the sliders to show how important each of the following is to you. It's a bit like you have 100 points to allocate amongst all the choices, so you're forced to prioritise. They're set so that the total number always adds up to 100.</p> 

				<ul>
					<li class='to-indent'>Feel free to rank 1 or 2 things very highly and the rest 0, or spread out the points equally, or however you want.</li>
					<li class='to-indent'>If sliders you already set keep changing as you set other sliders: decide your number allocations beforehand, then start from the top and work your way down. </li>
					<li class='to-indent'>If there's any problem, just type some free text in the comments box, or just email me directly at vignesh.dhileepan@nhs.net</li>
				</ul>
